# Prepare Forcing Files

## Author:
This code is developed by Ehsan Erfani @UW ATMOS.

## Requirements:
- Python3 in Jupyter Notebook (installed by Anaconda).
- See the beginning of each code for the required Python3 libraries.

#
## Description:
This code creates a forcing file (as initial and boundary conditions) that is used by a Lagrangian Large Eddy Simulation (LES), called SAM-UW.

## Inputs:
- NetCDF files from the Trajectory package (also available on Github).
- A default NetCDF forcing file (also available on Github).
