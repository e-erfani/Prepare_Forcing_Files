# Prepare Forcing Files
This code is developed by Ehsan Erfani @UW ATMOS.

#
## Description:
This code creates a forcing file (as initial and boundary conditions) that is used by a Lagrangian Large Eddy Simulation (LES), called SAM-UW.

Inputs:
- NetCDF files from the Trajectory package (also available on Github).
- An default NetCDF forcing file (also available on Github).
